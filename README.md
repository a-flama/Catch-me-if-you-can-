### Objective:
One of the most popular scams throughout industries is the Business Email Compromise (BEC). BECs are responsible for many notable real world scams, incurring $26 billion dollars of losses from 2016 to 2019 alone.

We'll be handling our own BEC situation, where a malicious actor (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) has sent phishing emails to many of our employees, trying to trick them into sending hundreds of thousands of dollars. To stop this, we'll be looking at some potentially malicious emails and inspecting .pcap files to determine which emails are legitimate and which ones are fraudulent.

#### **Since I have had experience with Wireshark and Pcap analysis, this lab allowed me to further solidify the following skills:**
- Inspecting pcap files and extracting their contents (In this scenario emails)
- Identifying fraudelent emails vs legitamate (Phishing!)
- How to identify the malicious/threat actor
